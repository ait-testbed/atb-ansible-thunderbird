# Ansible Role: Thunderbird 

Installs the Mozilla Thunderbird email client on supported systems.

Optionally, this role can populate the specified user's default Thunderbird profile with dummy emails (in mbox format) within the "Local Folders" Inbox, primarily for testing or demonstration purposes.

## Requirements

*   **Root Access:** Requires `become: yes` to install packages system-wide.
*   **Target OS:** Currently tested and supported on **Ubuntu**. May work on other Debian-based distributions but is not guaranteed.
*   **Ansible Version:** 2.9 or higher recommended.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):
